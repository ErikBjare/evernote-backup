Evernote Backup
----------------
It's for backuping your Evernote, obviously. 
But can also be used for exporting it (for later import to a superior service).


## Quirks

 - When setting high amount of documents, Geeknote gives you a list which requires keyboard input to get through before the rest of the script will run.
 - Geeknote is messing up Evernote's metadata, don't ask me why. I [already asked them](https://github.com/VitaliyRodnenko/geeknote/issues/272#issuecomment-129113905)

Solutions to the above welcome.
