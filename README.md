Evernote Export
----------------
It's for exporting your Evernote notes, obviously. (for later import to a superior service)


## Quirks

 - When setting high amount of documents, Geeknote gives you a list which requires keyboard input to get through before the rest of the script will run.
 - Geeknote is messing up Evernote's metadata, don't ask me why. I [already asked them](https://github.com/VitaliyRodnenko/geeknote/issues/272#issuecomment-129113905)
 - Evernote has rate limits on it's API, apparently. This makes things difficult at scale of more than a dozen notes (the exact number I'm unsure of, but I managed to dump at least 50 on one try).

Solutions to the above welcome.
